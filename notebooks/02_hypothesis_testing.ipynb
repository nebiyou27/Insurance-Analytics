    "Since the p-value is significantly below the 0.05 threshold, we **reject the null hypothesis**. This indicates that risk levels (as measured by claims or premiums) vary significantly across different provinces.  \n",

    "### **Business Implications**  \n",
    "- Risk-based pricing should consider provincial differences, as certain provinces may have higher claim frequencies or severities.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **Business Implications**  \n",

    "Since the p-value is significantly greater than 0.05, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. This means there is no statistical evidence to suggest that profit margins vary significantly by postal code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Implications**  \n",
    "- Profitability is likely influenced by other variables such as customer profile, vehicle type, or policy coverage rather than location alone.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **Business Implications**  \n",
    "- Gender-based risk assessment may be necessary for optimizing premium calculations.  \n",
    "- Regulatory considerations should be taken into account when adjusting premiums based on gender.  \n",

    "## **Conclusion**  \n",
    "- **Significant risk differences exist across provinces and between genders.** These factors should be incorporated into pricing and underwriting strategies.  \n",
    "- **No significant risk differences were found between postal codes.** Location at the postal code level may not be a useful risk predictor.  \n",
    "- **Profit margins do not significantly vary by postal code.** Other variables should be analyzed to optimize profitability.  \n",
